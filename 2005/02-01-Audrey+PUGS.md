[Audrey (nee Autrijus) Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang) joins the IRC channel #perl6 for the first time on Feb 1.

She creates [PUGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs_%28programming%29), a Perl 6 compiler written in Haskell, astonishingly quickly.

For a sense of the excitement surrounding PUGS in 2005 read [-Ofun article](https://github.com/perl6/museum-items/blob/master/2005/-Ofun.md) and/or ["Pugs -- Perl 6 For Real](http://cufp.org/archive/2005/slides/AtrijusTang.pdf) (a slideshow produced for Audrey's presentation at the 2005 Workshop for Commercial Users of Functional Programming in Tallinn, Estonia).
