Moritz writes the first version of [ilbot](https://github.com/moritz/ilbot), his irc logging solution, and starts publicly logging #perl6.

(He has maintained and improved ilbot to this day, and has accumulated daily logs for many freenode irc channels, including 13 years worth of #perl6, at [irclog.perlgeek.de](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/).)

[Aside to Moritz: ilbot readme links to http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot which gives me "We canâ€™t connect to the server at moritz.faui2k3.org."]
