Audrey (nee Autrijus) Tang) names "-Ofun" as primary optimization goal of Perl 6 project/culture.

2005 O'Reilly article ["-Ofun"](http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/post/ofun.html) by Geoff Broadwell (aka japhb). The following links in the article are no longer valid (here linked to proposed replacements):
