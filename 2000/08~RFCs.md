An [RFC process is established](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/meta/) and at the start of August, RFC announcements start pouring onto [the new announce list](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2000/08/page5.html) with corresponding discussion threads primarily on [perl6-language](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2000/08/page5.html) and [perl6-internals](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2000/08/page2.html).

Two months later [the process wraps up with 361 RFCs](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/). Samples from the first 50:

* [threads](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/1.html)

* [type inference](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/4.html)

* [lazy lists](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/24.html)

* [foreign objects](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/32.html)

* [infinities, NaNs, etc.](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/38.html)

* [bigints and bigrats](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/43.html)

* [inline doc](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/44.html)

* [async I/O](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/47.html)

* [bidi text](https://perl6.org/archive/rfc/50.html)

According to the original plan, Larry has 2 weeks to read all 361 and produce a new language spec draft!
