From [my own comment about this all a few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/254g8m/concerned_about_perl_unpopularity/cheypbk/):

> So the 2002 release date Nat declared was made up on the spot and all he had to go on was Skud's skeletal timeline which Skud charitably called "vaguely defined" for the "later stages of the project" (ie no dates, which is pretty vague for a timeline).

> If anyone took Nat's release date seriously they needed their head examined. If large chunks of the Perl community did, well, what on earth happened?
