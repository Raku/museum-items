Initial mailing list activity is directed to an interim perl.bootstrap mailing list. Sample posts:

* ["Near-term goals](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/07/msg10.html). (Most notably, in hindsight, "language spec draft [ 2nd week October ]".)

* ["Very little was decided in the "closed-door" meeting, other than "We're going to re-write Perl""](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/07/msg799.html).

* ["please create these lists ... perl6-internals ... perl6-language ... perl6-all ... perl6-announce"](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/2000/07/msg805.html). perl6-language would become the early driving force of the Perl 6 language design, perl6-internals of Parrot.
