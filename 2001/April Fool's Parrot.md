As stated in [an archive.org copy of an oreilly.com page from 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20010417000059/http://www.oreilly.com:80/news/parrotstory_0401.html), "Parrot was a very elaborate April Fools' Day hoax" that "caught a lot of people out" about "a new, dynamic programming language, Parrot, a language intended to merge the indubitable strengths of the twin Open Source scripting giants, Perl and Python.". (Despite it's slowness, I've linked to an archive.org copy of that page rather than the archive.oreilly.com copy, and rather than a perl.com page, because it's the simplest way I found to provide working links to the main elements of the prank.)

(In 2002, Dan Sugalski, the lead developer of [the (then) new VM](http://parrot.org) that was originally part of the Perl 6 project, named the VM after this prank.)
