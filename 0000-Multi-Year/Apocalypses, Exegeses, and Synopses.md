These "design documents" were generally numbered to match the chapters in the Programming Perl (5) book.

The [Apocalypses](https://perl6.org/archive/doc/apocalypse.html), originally authored by Larry, unveiled and justified particular parts of the design thru discussion. Their first versions were published from 2001 thru 2004.

The [Exegeses](https://perl6.org/archive/doc/exegesis.html), originally authored by Damian, interpreted and explained the corresponding part of the design thru examples. Their first versions were published from 2001 thru 2004.

The [Synopses](http://design.perl6.org/), originally authored by Larry, Damian, and many others, were used to guide Perl 6 language, compiler, and test development prior to shipping the first 6.c release. Their first versions were published from 2004 thru 2015.
