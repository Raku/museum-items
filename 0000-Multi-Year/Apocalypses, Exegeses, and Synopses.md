Apocalypses and Exegeses were first published from 2001 thru 2004. The Apocalypses, written by Larry, justified particular parts of the design thru discussion. The Exegeses, written by Damian, explained the corresponding part of the design thru examples.

Synopses were first published from 2004 thru 2015. The Synopses were the design documents used to guide Perl 6 language, compiler, and test development prior to shipping the first 6.c release.
