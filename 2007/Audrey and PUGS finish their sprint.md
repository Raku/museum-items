Audrey Tang presents "Perl 6 Today" to a hundred or so folk at YAPC::Asia 2007 in April ([one hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqM36cwcZOQ&index=151&t=0s&list=PLRuESFRW2Fa77XObvk7-BYVFwobZHdXdK)).

A few months later Audrey finds out she needs to drastically slow down. Her last post on #perl6 in 2007 is July. PUGS development falls off a cliff.

(Audrey didn't post on #perl6 again until April 2008. Thereafter she sporadically popped up (as [audreyt till 2009](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/search/?nick=audreyt;q=;offset=0) and [au from 2012 thru 2016]((https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/search/?nick=au;q=;offset=0)) with helpful tips, delightful quips, and fresh PUGS builds. She maintained the PUGS *build*, so it continued to build with the latest GHC Haskell compiler, even while it fell a decade out of date with the evolving Perl 6 spec, until around the time of the Christmas release of Perl 6 in December 2015.)
